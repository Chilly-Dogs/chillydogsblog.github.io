Femcels are weird, arguably even weirder than incels.

<p id="if-you-browsed">
If you have ever browsed
<span style="color:rgb(31, 255, 31)">4chan</span>,

especially 
<span style="color:red">/r9k/</span>
 & 
 <span style="color:red">/soc/</span>
 , or God forbid a 
 <span style="color:rgb(31, 255, 31)">4chan</span>
 <span style="color:rgb(66, 154, 255)">discord server</span>, you'll know immediately what I mean.

	While an introverted girl who browses 
	<span style="color:rgb(31, 255, 31)">4chan</span> 
	may seem like a 
	<span style="color:yellow">jackpot</span>
	 to you, 99.9% of the time it's not.

<p id="talk-primarily">
I'm going to be talking primarily about individuals on  <span style="color:rgb(31, 255, 31)">4chan</span>
related 
<span style="color:rgb(66, 154, 255)">discord servers</span>
, because you can get to know people better that way.

<p id="nikki">
The 
server I was previously apart of, had a girl named 
<span style="color:rgb(255, 8, 218)">Nikki</span>, who 
ALLEGEDLY would 
masturbate with 
<span style="color:rgb(32, 199, 232)">dead bird goop</span>, <span style="color:red">would cut herself</span>, and had a <span style="color:yellow">piss fetish</span>.
</p>

<p id="fed-posting">
And I may be overtly paranoid, but if you join a server and someone is talking to you like <span style="color:red">THIS</span> nigga, that's a dude.

<span style="color:red">TLDR</span> femcels are not great people, but don't get me wrong, incels on <span style="color:rgb(31, 255, 31)">4chan</span> are...bad too, but thats its own post for another day.
