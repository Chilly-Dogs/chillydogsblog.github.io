<h1 id="experience-with-God"> My Experience With God </h1>


<p id="its-fitting"> I think it's only fitting that I recall what <span style="color:red">God</span>
 has done for me, instead of only calling his existence terrifying. </p>


<p id="rough-time"> I had abit of a rough time in High School, I was a nerd, I had no friends, and was ridiculed quite often by everyone. </p> 

<p id="despite-this"> 
<span style="color:red">Despite this</span>, I would keep to myself. But there came a point I just couldn't take it anymore mentally. </p>

<p id="i-believe"> I believe my decrease in sanity had 2 factors, taking an extra pill of my epilepsy medicine and the bullying.</p>

<p id="the-reason"> The <span style="color:red">reason</span> for me taking an extra pill was because when I only took 1 pill, I would still have spasms but when I had 2 they basically be gone for the most part, the trade off being is that I would have more <span style="color:red">violent thoughts</span>. </p>

<p id="fucked-up"> Anyways, it started off with me being more fucked up in the head, not getting much sleep at night, and I thought everyone was out to get me. </p>

<p id="eventually"> Eventually, I have to start keeping the <span style="color:yellow">light</span> on at night when I sleep because I was so fucking scared of the dark. </p>

<p id="library"> One day in the library, I'm on my phone scrolling through Twitter. My back is laid against the bookshelf and there's a group sitting at a table behind it. They're talking about something, not sure what, but then I can't hear them at all. Not that weird. Then I hear some voices mumbling, it's quiet at first, then it gets louder, I'm freaking out thinking, <span style="color:red">"Is this actually happening?"</span>, and then it stops and I can hear the group as if they never stopped talking. </p>	

<p id="piss-scream"> I had 2 other major incidents similar to this, one being when I was going to the restroom, I was pulling down my pants taking a leak. Then I hear a woman screaming right behind me and I look back, but there's nothing there and the screaming is fading away. </p>

<p id="knock-scream"> The other major incident was when I was lying in bed one night, and I heard a <span style="color:red">knock</span> at the window. I get up, pick up a flashlight and shine it outside, but I don't see anything. I lie back down and hear another <span style="color:red">knock</span>, I get up again and shine my flashlight outside but there's nothing there, and I lie back in bed. The 3rd time, I hear a <span style="color:red">knock</span> but it doesn't stop and it gets louder, I get really scared and grab the Bible beside me and put it on my chest, and the knocking ceases</p>

<p id="the-end"> So yeah, this is <span style="color:yellow">my experience with God</span>, I have other stories to tell, which I may write about. But I just wanted to tell THIS story in specific.</p>
