<p id="header"> My thoughts on God </p>

<p id="nephilim"> 
So let's say you're pre-flood earth and you have sex with a fallen angel, and then your son is basically a nephilim.

Would that mean he has no chance of going to heaven no matter what he does
because he was born half-demon?
</p>

<p id="devout">
	And on that note, how much of a devout follower do you have to be to
get into heaven? You could read the Bible, pray morning & night, but when you die
God says, "I do not know you, depart from me" and then you're just sent to hell and 
you didn't live your life to the fullest because you wanted to be a good Christian boy
and follow God's example. But now you're in hell, in molten lava, your skin burning off
your bones for all eternity. 
</p>

<p id="heaven">
And how do we know what Heaven is even like, what if you just become apart of God, and every
action you want to do, is decided by majority vote by all the souls inside of God. That doesn't sound that great.
</p>



<p id="created-who">
And we're just forced into this life, to entertain Mr. God. And someone must have created HIM, so there's
gotta be more like him, but maybe we can't worship those other Gods because we're bound by HIS creation
and each God has made their own little galaxy to rule over.
</p>

<p id="fucked">
I just wanna clarify this isn't me trying to be edgy, as I am religious. But I was just looking at the existance of God, in a different point of view.
